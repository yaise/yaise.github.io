Alright, alright, alright(Matthew Mcconaughey style) ...hello world! 

Thanks to my parents, I came to be on this day. I'd say it's a good day :) A good day to start something new. 

I'm not much of a writer or a blogger and it's time to change that. Still trying to figure out structure, content but hey! you gotta start somewhere and we software engineers like to do things incrementally, not to mention DIY. 

So this here is ver 0.0.1; on github, with the stock and pleasently minimalistic design that ```jekyll new``` spit out for me.
