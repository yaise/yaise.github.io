So I decided in April of last year that I'd try to write more. However much like how things get deprioritized in software projects, writing did. A lot of stuff happened on the personal front and I ignored this site for quite some time. 

Time to take a second stab at it. Perhaps I should start with at least 1 post per month to get into the groove. 

Also, I just pointed this blog to [ssasalatti.io](http://sasalatti.io) . I use namecheap as my domain registrar and it took a couple of tries and googling to get the CNAME and A records setup correctly but it all works now. IO domains look cool but aren't cheap!
